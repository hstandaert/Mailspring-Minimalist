This is a work-in-progress theme, so any feedback can be submitted as a [Github issue](https://github.com/hstandaert/mailspring-minimalist/issues/new).

## Motivation

I've been using Mailspring for a while now and love how easy-to-use it is and how quickly you can navigate as a power user. However, the design felt somewhat crowded and I sometimes find it hard to keep focus on what matters.

I believe that this can be accomplished through some extra spacing and some UI updates that soothe the eyes ðŸ‘€.

## Inspiration

As a developer, I have some insight in what a good UI looks like. But it's another thing to create one. So I went ahead and did a quick search on Behance, which lead me to this beautiful design from [Aleksei Balashov](https://dribbble.com/addiken).

You can find it on [this link](https://www.behance.net/gallery/100489301/Email-Client/modules/579670751).
